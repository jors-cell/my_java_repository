Employee Information System (LabAct1)
This program is to get the info of employees like name, age, and work, then compute how much their salary is in one day.

import java.util.Scanner;
> We put Scanner here so we can type something when the program runs. It helps us get input from users.

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
> This one makes the scanner ready to use. Like, it starts listening to what user type.

System.out.print("Enter your first name: ");
String firstName = scanner.nextLine();
> Program ask what your first name is. Users type it. Then it saves the inside variable called `firstName`.

System.out.print("Enter your last name: ");
String lastName = scanner.nextLine();
> Now it asks your last name. It also gets saved inside `lastName`.

System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
int age = scanner.nextInt();
> This asks how old you are. It must be number only, no letters.

System.out.print("Enter hours worked: ");
double hoursWorked = scanner.nextDouble();
> It asks how many hours you work in one day. It can be a number with points like 5.5 or 6.0.

System.out.print("Enter hourly wage: ");
double hourlyWage = scanner.nextDouble();
> It asks how much you get paid every hour you work. Also a number, like 50.0 or 100.5.

String fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
> This is the first name and last name with space in the middle, to make a full name.

double dailySalary = hoursWorked * hourlyWage;
> This multiplies how many hours you work with how much you pay per hour. Thatâ€™s how it gets a daily salary.

> It shows all the answers like:
Full name
Age
Daily salary in peso
